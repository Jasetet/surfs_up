- The average temperature is almost 4 degrees cooler in December than it is in July. 
- The coldest it got in December was 56 degrees, this is quite a bit cooler than June which is 64 degrees. 
- The hottes temperatures are not much different, 83 degrees in December and 85 degrees in June.

## Summary
The temperatures don't seem to differ too much from June to December, the biggest change was the low temperature. This should not affect the surf shop much because the highest temperatures were about the same and the average was only about 4 degrees cooler in December. One thing that should be looked at is if there is an increase in precipitation in December to see if that will decrease sales at the surf shop. Another thing that would be good to examine are different years to check to see the changes in weather per year.
